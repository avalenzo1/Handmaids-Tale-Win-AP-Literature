    “With the decline of birth rates and uncertainty of the future of the United States…we plan to create the Republic of Gilead,” said the new autocrat of the nation. On August 24, 7:53 PM, a group of roughly 52 unnamed individuals fatally wounded the president and all congress members with machine guns. The deaths of the president and congress have left many Americans and Europe at a loss. The United States Army has declared a state of emergency today at 7:59 AM. The army said in a press conference that Islamic terrorists were most likely responsible for yesterday. These unfortunate events bring a dark milestone in the history of the United States.
