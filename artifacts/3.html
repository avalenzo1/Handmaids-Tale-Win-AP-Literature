    "With the decline of birth rates and uncertainty of the future of the United
    Statesâ€¦we plan to create the Republic of Gilead," said the new autocrat of
    the nation. On August 24, 7:53 PM, a group of roughly 52 unnamed individuals
    fatally wounded the president and all congress members with machine guns. An
    estimated 300 people have died as a result. The deaths of the president and
    congress have left many Americans at a loss. The United States Army has
    declared a state of emergency today at 7:59 AM. The army said in a press
    conference that Islamic terrorists were most likely responsible for
    yesterday. "We're dealing with the situation. Please remain calm; everything
    is under control." Unfortunately, these unfortunate events will bring a dark
    milestone in the history of the United States.
