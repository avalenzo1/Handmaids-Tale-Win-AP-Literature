  <h3>
    The Republic of Gilead has recently setback women's rights. What are your
    thoughts?
  </h3>

  <blockquote speaker="Serena Joy">
    As I've mentioned countless times, I have firm beliefs about what makes a
    woman virtuous. For one, a wife's only concern should be to stay at home and
    never work. As wives, we should look forward only to catering to our family.
    And losing some 'liberties' isn't something many other women or I should
    worry about, I'll tell you that. Also, if you read Ephesians Chapter 5 in
    the bible, we're taught to respect and listen to our husband's needs.

    As a tired american, I applaud the Republic of Gilead for taking things into
    their own hands.
