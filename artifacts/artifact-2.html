    Interview with Serena Joy, Popular Conservative Televangelist, and a Private
    Gilead Citizen.

    What are your thoughts on the

  </h3>

  <blockquote speaker="Serena Joy">
    Personally, I believe that overthrowing the US government was the only
    solution. As a once exhausted American, I applaud the Republic of Gilead for
    taking things into its own hands. They rightfully used the right of
    revolution to overthrow the current government, which, mind you, has not
    been addressing the issues we have had for a while. It's getting
    inconceivably hard to conceive children as the days go by. Savages murder
    innocent babies with abortions, so we are facing the wrath of our Savior as
    a result.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote speaker="Private Citizen">
    My thoughts on the coup? I cannot begin to express my shock at how the
    situation was treated. The United States, the 300-year-old superpower—gone
    just like that. The entire government—gone just like that. The president and
    every single congressman, all with their own lives, aspirations, beliefs,
    hopes, and fears, are just dead. But the most bizarre thing was how the
    media told everyone to calm down. Nothing about the coup would've made
    anyone calm down, nothing.

  <h3>What do you expect for the future of the country?</h3>

  <blockquote speaker="Serena Joy">
    I expect that we will return to traditional holy values. As an evangelist
    preacher for the teachings of God, I believe that it is vital as a nation
    that we return to these values in an increasingly more perverted world. As
    I've mentioned previously, there are now mothers—aborting—no—killing their
    own babies who could've been decent human beings. We cannot keep going on
    this path because once we accept a blatant sin as 'okay,' the cycle
    continues with the rest of them.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote speaker="Private Citizen">
    If I were to be truthful, I don't know. I'm frankly uneasy about the future
    of this country. We've already lost the right to own our own property, work,
    or protest. Anything is possible at this point, so Gilead can just as easily
    remove more of our freedoms. I will say that ever since the overthrow of the
    government happened, I've progressively felt more dehumanized and degraded.
    As the mother of a young daughter, my only desire is to escape this country;
    I don't want this for her.

  <h3>
    Do you think the government changes are beneficial or detrimental to the
    future of the country?
  </h3>

  <blockquote speaker="Serena Joy">
    As a follower of God's words, I believe that government changes are more
    than beneficial to this country's future! We need to return to those classic
    Christian, pardon, Gileadian Christian values. Yes, we have lost many
    American liberties, but I argue that these liberties aren't necessary
    anymore.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote speaker="Private Citizen">
    With the new regulations passed by the government, I see nothing but a
    dangerous future for us. They're reversing the laws and liberties we once
    had. The 'temporary' suspension of the US constitution, for example, is
    detrimental to the future. We cannot continue as a free country without the
    bill of rights. Because they suspended it, there is so much censorship in
    the media; it's impossible to get unbiased news nowadays. And, it's not as
    if these laws weren't placed for no reason either.

  <h3>
    The Republic of Gilead has recently setback women's rights. What are your
    thoughts?
  </h3>

  <blockquote speaker="Serena Joy">
    As I've mentioned countless times, I have firm beliefs about what makes a
    woman virtuous. For one, a wife's only concern should be to stay at home and
    never work. As wives, we should look forward only to catering to our family.
    And losing some 'liberties' isn't something many other women or I should
    worry about, I'll tell you that. Also, if you read Ephesians Chapter 5 in
    the bible, we're taught to respect and listen to our husband's needs.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote speaker="Private Citizen">
    I am deeply fraught by our sudden loss of rights. It's unfortunate that
    after so many years of development, trying to make the US equal, it was all
    quickly undone in months. I lost my job, and now my friends and I cannot use
    our own Compunumbers to buy food; it's rather excessive. Just talking about
    this brings me at risk because of the suspension of the 1st amendment.
