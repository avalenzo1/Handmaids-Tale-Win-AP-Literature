  <blockquote speaker="Serena Joy">
    Personally, I believe that overthrowing the US government was the only
    solution. As a once exhausted American, I applaud the Republic of Gilead for
    taking things into its own hands. They rightfully used the right of
    revolution to overthrow the current government, which, mind you, has not
    been addressing the issues we have had for a while. It's getting
    inconceivably hard to conceive children as the days go by. Savages murder
    innocent babies with abortions, so we are facing the wrath of our Savior as
    a result.

    The Republic of Gilead has recently setback women's rights. What are your
    thoughts?
  </h3>

  <blockquote speaker="Serena Joy">
    As I've mentioned countless times, I have firm beliefs about what makes a
    woman virtuous. For one, a wife's only concern should be to stay at home and
    never work. As wives, we should look forward only to catering to our family.
    And losing some 'liberties' isn't something many other women or I should
    worry about, I'll tell you that. Also, if you read Ephesians Chapter 5 in
    the bible, we're taught to respect and listen to our husband's needs.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote speaker="Private Citizen">
    I am deeply fraught by our sudden loss of rights. It's unfortunate that
    after so many years of development, trying to make the US equal, it was all
    quickly undone in months. I lost my job, and now my friends and I cannot use
    our own Compunumbers to buy food; it's rather excessive. Just talking about
    this brings me at risk because of the suspension of the 1st amendment.
