  <em>"Nolite Bastardes Carborundorum"</em>
</h2>

<p>
  <strong>For the future Handmaid:</strong><br>
  Don't let the Commanders <em>abuse</em> you;<br>
  He is wicked, and filled with ego.<br>
  Don't let the Wives <em>patronize</em> you;<br>
  You shan't take their words to heart.<br>
  Don’t let the Angels <em>frighten</em> you;<br>
  Don’t let the Eyes <em>frighten</em> you;<br>
  They only seek to blind the eyes of the enlightened.<br>
  Don’t let the Guardians <em>deceive</em> you;<br>
  Don't let the Aunts <em>indoctrinate</em> you;<br>
  As they are false prophets.<br>
  Don't let the Marthas <em>belittle</em> you.<br>
</p>

<p>
  They all want to dehumanize your existence,<br>
  And the point is to keep your resistance.<br>
  You are more than what they say,<br>
  You are not Of anything but yourself,<br>
  You are not an object, forced to have a baby,<br>
  You are a human—a woman.<br>
  <!-- Don't let those bastards grind you down. -->
